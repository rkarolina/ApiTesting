# About me

Hi!
My name is Karolina and I'm entusiastic about the IT industry ðŸ’™
I like to know how the systems are structured and where can I find possible errors and improvements in the applications.
I have finished the IT Management (Applied Computer Science) studies and decided to develop my skills in software testing, business analysis and data migration.

I have learned how to manage my files in the Terminal.
After cloning my repository I used the following commands to add my first commit to Github:

- <b> git add <NameOfMyFile$> </b>
- <b> git status </b>
- <b> git commit -m "what is in my file" </b>
- <b> git push </b>
